## Good vs Bad Design:

### What is good design?
Good design is something that looks good, works well, and/or is generally easy and fun to use. 
For example, Google Chrome, the web browser, has a nice GUI(Graphical User Interface), is easy to use, and has cool features like bookmarks, extensions, and more.
Google Chrome also has its flaws though, and this is where bad design comes in.
### What is bad design?
Bad design is some program or machine that does not work well, does not look good, and/or is not easy or fun to use. An example of a bad design quality is how Chrome tends to take up quite a bit of memory, at least compared to some other browsers. 
This can be problematic for people with less powerful computers, as it can take up a significant amount of the computer's resources.

## Examples of Good and Bad Design

| Good Design | Bad Design |
| ----------- | ---------- |
| **Supercars like Ferrari and Lamborghini:** | **Paper juice and milk cartons:** |
| Aerodynamic bodies for less resistance | Hard to open |
| Low weight, lots of power = very fast | Easy to tear when opening |
| Cool-looking bodywork that attracts eyes | Not closable after being opened |
