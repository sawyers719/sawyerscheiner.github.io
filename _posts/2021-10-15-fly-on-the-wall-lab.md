# Fly on the Wall Lab

### Overview:
In this lab, we acted as if we were a "fly on a wall," observing daily life around Horace Mann, without interfering or being known. We spent time in class walking around the school taking notes on what we saw, and we also made our own observations outside of class time. Using these observations that we made about people, environments, objects, activities, etc. around campus, we can find potential ideas, or problems that may have to be solved. Eventually we can design something that will be able to solve these problems noted in the activity, but we will not be doing that today. 

### Observations:
- Field filled with activities, spikeball, soccer balls/goals, footballs, etc. 
- Tents with chairs and boards for potential outside classes.
- Bleachers for watching sports games, doing homework, or just hanging out with friends.
- Many people on field playing football, soccer, spikeball, volleyball, etc. Having fun.
- Hallways generally empty during class time.
- Between classes many people walking/running to class(depending on the time), standing outside classes, people on the stairways, talking to friends, on their phones, etc.
- In the library: people sitting quietly studying, people talking, people on their phones, people playing videogames, etc.
