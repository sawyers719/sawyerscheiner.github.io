# Fly on the Wall Lab

## Overview:
In this lab, we acted as if we were a "fly on a wall," observing daily life around Horace Mann, without interfering or being known. We spent time in class walking around the school taking notes on what we saw, and we also made our own observations outside of class time. Using these observations that we made about people, environments, objects, activities, etc. around campus, we can find potential ideas, or problems that may have to be solved. Eventually we can design something that will be able to solve these problems noted in the activity, but we will not be doing that today.
